"""
Approach & Reasoning:

We increment the large integer by 1 from right to left (least significant digit first).

- If current digit < 9 → increment it and return (no carry)
- If digit == 9 → set to 0 and continue (carry over to next digit)
- If all digits are 9 → the number was like 999 → becomes 1000 → return [1, 0, ..., 0]

We modify the input array in-place when possible.

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) extra (O(n) only if we need to add a new digit)
