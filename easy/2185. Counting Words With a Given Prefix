class Solution:
    def prefixCount(self, words: List[str], pref: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        # Iterate through each word in the list
        for word in words:
            # Check if the word starts with the given prefix
            if word.startswith(pref):
                count += 1
        return count

'''
Approach:
1. Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
2. Use the `startswith` method to check if the word starts with the given prefix `pref`.
3. If the condition is satisfied, increment the `count` by 1.
4. Return the total `count` after iterating through all the words.

Time Complexity:
- O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), as no additional data structures are used apart from a counter.
