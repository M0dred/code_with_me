Approach:
- Each operation subtracts the smaller number from the larger one.
- Instead of performing one subtraction at a time, note that we can subtract the smaller number as many times as possible until the remainder is smaller than it.
  So, num1, num2 follow the same recurrence as the Euclidean algorithm for GCD.
- At each step, add `num1 // num2` (or `num2 // num1`) to the count.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(num1, num2))) — same as Euclidean GCD.
Space Complexity: O(1).
