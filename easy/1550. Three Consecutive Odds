Approach:
1. Check if array length is at least 3; if not, return False.
2. Iterate through the array up to index len(arr) - 2.
3. For each index i, check if arr[i], arr[i+1], and arr[i+2] are all odd (using modulo 2 == 1).
4. If any set of three consecutive numbers are odd, return True.
5. If no such set is found, return False.
Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array, where n is the length of arr.
Space Complexity: O(1) - uses only a constant amount of extra space.
