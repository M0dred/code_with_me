                i += 2    # two-bit character
            else:

Approach:
- Simulate the decoding from left to right.
- If bits[i] == 0, it's a one-bit character → move i += 1.
- If bits[i] == 1, it's a two-bit character (10 or 11) → move i += 2.
- Stop before the last position. The last character is one-bit iff we land exactly on index n - 1.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
