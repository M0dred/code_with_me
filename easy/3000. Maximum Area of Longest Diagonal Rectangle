Approach:
The solution iterates through a list of rectangle dimensions, where each dimension is represented by a pair of integers [length, width]. For each rectangle:
1. Compute the squared diagonal length using the Pythagorean theorem (length² + width²). The square root is not needed since we only compare relative values.
2. If the squared diagonal is greater than the current maximum diagonal, update both the maximum diagonal and the corresponding area (length * width).
3. If the squared diagonal equals the current maximum diagonal, update the area only if the current rectangle's area is larger.
4. Finally, return the maximum area found.

Time Complexity:
- O(n), where n is the number of rectangles in the input list. We iterate through the list once, performing constant-time operations (multiplication, comparison) for each rectangle.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the maximum diagonal and maximum area, regardless of the input size.
