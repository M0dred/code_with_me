class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2

"""
Approach & Reasoning:

This is the most elegant O(1) solution.

Explanation:
- low // 2 = number of integers from 0 to low-1 that are even (i.e., floor division by 2)
- (high + 1) // 2 = number of integers from 0 to high that are even

The number of odd numbers up to x is:
- If x is odd: (x + 1) // 2
- If x is even: x // 2

So:
- Number of odds <= high = (high + 1) // 2
- Number of odds < low = low // 2

Therefore:
    odds in [low, high] = (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2

Time Complexity : O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
