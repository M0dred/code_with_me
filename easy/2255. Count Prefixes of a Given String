        count = 0
        for word in words:

Approach:
1. Initialize a counter `count` to track how many words are prefixes of `s`.
2. Iterate over each `word` in the `words` array.
3. For each `word`, check if it is a prefix of `s` by using the built-in `startswith()` method.
4. If it is a prefix, increment the counter.
5. After iterating through all words, return the counter.

Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word. The `startswith()` check runs in O(m) time for each word.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the counter.
