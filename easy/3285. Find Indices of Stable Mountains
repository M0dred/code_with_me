class Solution:
    def stableMountains(self, height: List[int], threshold: int) -> List[int]:
        stable_mountains = []
        for i in range(1, len(height)):
            if height[i - 1] > threshold:

        return stable_mountains

'''
Approach:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the indices of stable mountains.
    2. Iterate through the height array starting from the second element (index 1).
    3. For each mountain, check if the height of the mountain immediately before it is strictly greater than the threshold.
    4. If it is, add the current mountain's index to the list of stable mountains.
    5. Finally, return the list of stable mountain indices.

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of mountains. The algorithm iterates through the input array once.
