"""
Approach & Reasoning:
We need to check if the number formed by the prefix nums[0..i] is divisible by 5.
Building the actual number can exceed integer limits (n <= 10^5), so we avoid that.

Key insight: We only care about divisibility by 5 → we can track the number modulo 5.
When we append a new bit b (0 or 1):
    current = (current * 2 + b) % 5
This keeps the value in range [0..4] at all times.

Since we're dealing with binary, multiplying by 2 is like left shift,
and taking %5 preserves divisibility information.

Time Complexity : O(n) — single pass
Space Complexity: O(1) — only tracking current remainder (excluding output array)
