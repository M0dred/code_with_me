class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        # Each operation is one of: "++X", "X++", "--X", "X--".
        # The middle character uniquely tells the intent: '+' => +1, '-' => -1.
        return sum(1 if op[1] == '+' else -1 for op in operations)

'''
Approach:
- Each operation either increases or decreases the value by 1.
- The second character of the string is '+' for increments and '-' for decrements.
- Sum +1 for every '+' operation and -1 for every '-' operation.

Time Complexity:
- O(n), where n is the number of operations.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), using only a constant amount of extra space.
