Approach: 
The solution uses a greedy approach by trying different numbers of operations from the start. For each possible number of removals (0 to len(nums)//3), we:
1. Remove that many groups of 3 elements from the beginning
2. Check if remaining elements are distinct using set comparison
3. Track minimum operations needed to achieve distinct elements
For arrays <= 3 length, we can handle them in at most 1 operation
If no solution found, return ceiling of length/3 as worst case
Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is length of nums
Space complexity: O(n) for creating sets

        return min_ops if min_ops != float('inf') else (n + 2) // 3


Approach:
1. Iterate through possible operation counts from 0 to maximum number of 3-element removals.
2. For each count, simulate removing the first 3 * ops elements.
3. Check if the remaining elements are all distinct using a set.
4. If yes, update minimum operations and break early since we want the smallest possible number of operations.
5. Return the minimum number of operations found.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst case due to set comparison in a loop up to n/3.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to use of a set to check uniqueness.
