'''
Approach:
1. Create an empty list result to store indices of words containing x.
2. Iterate through the words array using index i (0 to len(words)-1).
3. For each word, check if x is present using the in operator.
4. If x is found in words[i], append i to result.
5. Return the result list (empty if no words contain x).
Time Complexity: O(n * m) - where n is len(words), m is average length of words.
Space Complexity: O(k) - where k is number of words containing x (for result list).
