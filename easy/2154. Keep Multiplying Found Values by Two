Approach & Reasoning:
The problem requires us to start with 'original' and keep multiplying it by 2 
as long as the current value exists in the array nums.

Key observations:
- We may need to check the same value multiple times (e.g., 3 → 6 → 12 → 24)
- List lookup with 'in' operator is O(n), which would make worst-case time O(n * k)
    where k is the number of doublings.
- Since n <= 1000 and values <= 1000, maximum doublings is small (~10),
    but using a set reduces lookup from O(n) to O(1).

Time Complexity : O(n)  – building set takes O(n), doublings are negligible
Space Complexity: O(n)  – for the hash set
