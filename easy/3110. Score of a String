Approach:
1. Iterate over the string from index 1 to the end.
2. For each character, calculate the absolute difference between its ASCII value and the ASCII value of the previous character.
3. Accumulate the differences into `score`.
4. Return the total score.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- We iterate through the string once.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only constant extra space is used for the score.
