'''
Approach:
1. Create an answer array `ans` of the same length as the input array `nums`, initialized with zeros.
2. Iterate through each index `i` from 0 to len(nums)-1:
   - Set ans[i] = nums[nums[i]], as per the problem's requirement.
3. Return the resulting array `ans`.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the nums array.
   - Iterate through the array once, performing O(1) operations per element.
   - Total: O(N).

Space Complexity: O(N).
   - The answer array `ans` requires O(N) space.
   - No additional data structures are used, and the input array is not counted in space complexity.
