Approach & Reasoning:

We need to pack all apples into as few boxes as possible.

Since apples from the same pack can be split across boxes, the problem reduces to:
- Total number of apples = sum(apple)
- We need to cover this total using the box capacities.

To minimize the number of boxes:
- Use the largest available boxes first (greedy choice).

Sort capacity descending and cumulatively add until the sum >= total_apples.

Time Complexity : O(m log m) due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(1)
