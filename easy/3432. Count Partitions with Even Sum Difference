class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        if total % 2 == 1:
            return 0
        return len(nums) - 1

"""
Approach & Reasoning:

For any partition:
    difference = left_sum - right_sum = 2 * left_sum - total

We want this difference to be even.

- 2 * left_sum is always even
- Therefore, 2 * left_sum - total is even if and only if total is even

So:
- If total is odd → difference is always odd → 0 valid partitions
- If total is even → difference is always even → all (n-1) partitions are valid

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
