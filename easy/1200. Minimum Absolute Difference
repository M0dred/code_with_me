"""
Approach & Reasoning:

We need all pairs with the smallest absolute difference among any two distinct elements.

Key idea:
After sorting, the minimum absolute difference must occur between two adjacent elements.
So we sort the array and only compare neighboring values.

Steps:
1) Sort arr.
2) Scan adjacent pairs (arr[i-1], arr[i]) and compute diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1].
3) Track the smallest diff seen so far:
   - If we find a smaller diff, reset the result list to just this pair.
   - If we find the same diff, append this pair.
4) Because we scan in sorted order, the resulting pairs are already in ascending order.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra (excluding the output list).
