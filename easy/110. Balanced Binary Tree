"""
Approach & Reasoning:

A binary tree is height-balanced if for every node:
    abs(height(left) - height(right)) <= 1

We use a bottom-up DFS that returns:
- the height of the subtree if it is balanced
- -1 as a sentinel value if it is not balanced

For each node:
1) Compute left height; if it is -1, propagate -1 upward.
2) Compute right height; if it is -1, propagate -1 upward.
3) If the height difference is > 1, return -1.
4) Otherwise return 1 + max(left_height, right_height).

Finally, the tree is balanced iff the result is not -1.

Time Complexity: O(n) because each node is visited once.
Space Complexity: O(h) for recursion stack, where h is the tree height (worst-case O(n)).
