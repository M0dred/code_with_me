Approach:
1. Count the frequency of each number using Counter.
2. For a number to be completely paired, its count must be divisible by 2.
3. If any number has an odd frequency, it's impossible to form valid pairs, so return False.
4. If all counts are even, return True.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- We iterate over the nums list once to count frequencies and once to validate frequencies.

Space Complexity: O(n)
- We use a Counter (hash map) to store frequencies.
