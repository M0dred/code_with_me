Approach:
1. The problem requires checking if every pair of adjacent elements in the array has different parity.
2. We iterate through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element.
3. For each pair of adjacent elements, we check if their parities are the same by using the modulo operator (`%`).
4. If we find any pair with the same parity, we return `False`.
5. If we finish the loop without finding any such pair, we return `True`.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- We iterate through the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- We use a constant amount of extra space.
