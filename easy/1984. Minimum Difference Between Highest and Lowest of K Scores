"""
Approach & Reasoning:

We need to choose k scores such that (max - min) is minimized.

Key idea:
After sorting, the best group of k scores must form a contiguous window in the sorted array.
For any chosen k elements, the minimum and maximum are some two elements; in sorted order,
taking exactly the elements between them gives a contiguous window of size k with the same
(or smaller) max-min range.

Steps:
1) Sort nums.
2) Slide a window of length k across the sorted array.
    For each window [i .. i+k-1], difference = nums[i+k-1] - nums[i].
3) Return the minimum difference found.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) scan.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra (or O(n) depending on sorting implementation).
