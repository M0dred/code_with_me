"""
Approach & Reasoning:

Since exactly one number appears n times, and all others appear once:
- The repeated number must appear at least twice.
- We can track seen numbers in a set.
- The first number we encounter that is already in the set is the repeated one.

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
