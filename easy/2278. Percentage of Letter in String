class Solution:
    def percentageLetter(self, s: str, letter: str) -> int:
        count = s.count(letter)
        return (count * 100) // len(s)

'''
Approach:
1. Use the `count()` function to count how many times `letter` appears in the string `s`.
2. Compute the percentage by: (count of letter * 100) // total length of the string.
3. Use integer division `//` to automatically round down the result to the nearest whole number.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- n is the length of string s. The count operation is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only a few variables are used regardless of the input size.
