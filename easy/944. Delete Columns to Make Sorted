"""
Approach & Reasoning:

- The grid has len(strs) rows and len(strs[0]) columns.
- For each column j, we check if the characters strs[0][j], strs[1][j], ..., strs[n-1][j]
  are in non-decreasing lexicographical order.
- To do this, we iterate through the rows for that column and check if any consecutive pair
  has strs[row][col] < strs[row-1][col].
- If yes, the column is not sorted → must delete it.
- Count such columns.

Time Complexity : O(rows × cols) = O(n × m) where n = number of strings, m = length of each string
Space Complexity: O(1)
