Approach:
- Each number only needs to be adjusted to the nearest multiple of 3.
- If v % 3 == 0, it is already divisible by 3 → 0 operations.
- If v % 3 == 1, either subtract 1 or add 2 → minimum is 1 operation.
- If v % 3 == 2, either add 1 or subtract 2 → minimum is 1 operation.
- So the answer is simply the count of elements whose remainder is not 0.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
