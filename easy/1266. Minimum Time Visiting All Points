Approach & Reasoning:

To move from point A (x1,y1) to point B (x2,y2):
- You can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Each move costs 1 second.
- Diagonal move reduces both |dx| and |dy| by 1 in one second.

Therefore, the minimum time is the Chebyshev distance: max(|x2-x1|, |y2-y1|).

- First, you can use diagonal moves min(dx, dy) times → reduces both differences.
- Then, you need |dx-dy| straight moves in the remaining direction.

So total seconds = max(dx, dy).

We just sum this value between every consecutive pair of points.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
