Approach:
1. Iterate through each character in the string `num` using its index.
2. Convert each character to an integer.
3. If the index is even, add its value to `even_sum`.
4. If the index is odd, add its value to `odd_sum`.
5. Finally, compare the two sums and return True if they are equal, otherwise False.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- We iterate through the string once.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only constant extra space is used for the sums.
