Approach:
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
   - Each state in the game is `(mouse_position, cat_position, turn)`.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If the mouse reaches node `0`, it wins.
   - If the mouse and cat are in the same position, the cat wins.

3. **Degree Calculation:**
   - Compute the number of available moves for the mouse and the cat.
   - Adjust the catâ€™s degree to avoid the hole (node `0`).

4. **Topological Sorting Using BFS:**
   - We process known winning and losing states first.
   - If a state has no remaining moves, its result is determined by the last move.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - O(n^3), as each state `(mouse, cat, turn)` is processed at most once.

6. **Space Complexity:**
   - O(n^3), storing the DP and degree tracking tables.
