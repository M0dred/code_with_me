Approach & Reasoning:

This is a classic DP problem similar to longest common subsequence, but maximizing dot product.

State:
- dp[i][j] = maximum dot product using first i elements of nums1 and first j of nums2

Transitions:
For each position (i,j):
- We can ignore nums1[i-1] → dp[i-1][j]
- Or ignore nums2[j-1] → dp[i][j-1]
- Or use both: nums1[i-1] * nums2[j-1] plus:
  - 0 (if this is the only pair in subsequence)
  - or best previous dot product dp[i-1][j-1]

We take the maximum of all these options.

Since subsequences must be non-empty, but we cover all possibilities including single pairs, the final answer dp[n][m] is correct.

Time Complexity : O(n × m)
Space Complexity: O(n × m)
