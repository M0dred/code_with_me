class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        # The answer equals the Gray-decoding of n:
        # ans = n ^ (n>>1) ^ (n>>2) ^ ... until n becomes 0.
        ans = 0
        while n:
            ans ^= n
            n >>= 1
        return ans

'''
Approach:
- The allowed operations correspond to moving along a Gray-code order.
- The minimum number of operations to turn n into 0 equals the Gray-decoding of n,
  which is computed by cumulative XOR of n with all its right shifts.

Time Complexity: O(log n)  (one loop per bit)
Space Complexity: O(1)
