Approach & Reasoning:

This is the classic "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" applied row by row.

Key idea:
- Treat each row as the base of a histogram
- heights[j] = number of consecutive '1's above current row in column j
- When we see a '0', reset height to 0
- For each row, compute the largest rectangle area in this histogram using monotonic stack
- The stack keeps indices of increasing heights
- When we find a smaller height, we pop and calculate area with that height

Time Complexity: O(rows × cols)
Space Complexity: O(cols)
