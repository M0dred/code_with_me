Approach & Reasoning:

A number has exactly 4 divisors in two possible forms:
1. p^3 (divisors: 1, p, p^2, p^3)
2. p * q (p and q distinct primes) → divisors: 1, p, q, p*q

We iterate through each number in nums:
- For each num, count divisors and their sum by checking from 1 to sqrt(num)
- If a divisor i is found, count both i and num//i (unless i == num//i)
- If exactly 4 divisors → add their sum to answer

Time Complexity : O(n × √m) where m = max(nums[i]) ≤ 10^5 → acceptable (n≤10^4)
Space Complexity: O(1)
