Approach:
1. **Bit Analysis:**
   - Each bit position (from 0 to 23) is independent of others for the bitwise AND operation.
   - A combination of numbers with a 1 at the same bit position will have a non-zero AND result for that bit.

2. **Count 1s per Bit Position:**
   - For each number in `candidates`, check each bit position.
   - If a bit is 1, increment the counter for that bit position in `bit_count`.

3. **Find Maximum Count:**
   - The largest combination size is the maximum value in `bit_count`, as it represents the number of numbers sharing the same bit position with a 1.

Time Complexity:
- O(n * b), where `n` is the number of candidates and `b` is the number of bits (24 for 10^7).

Space Complexity:
- O(b), for storing `bit_count`.
