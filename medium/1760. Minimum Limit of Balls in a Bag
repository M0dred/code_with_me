Approach:
1. **Binary Search on Maximum Penalty**:
   - We define the penalty as the largest bag size.
   - We apply **binary search** on the possible range of penalties `[1, max(nums)]`.
   - `mid` represents the candidate penalty size, and we check if we can achieve this with at most `maxOperations` splits.

2. **Checking Feasibility (`isPossible` function)**:
   - If a bag has more than `mid` balls, we calculate the **number of operations required** to break it down into bags of size at most `mid`.
   - If the total required operations are `â‰¤ maxOperations`, then `mid` is a valid penalty.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - If `isPossible(mid)`, try reducing the max penalty (`right = mid`).
   - Otherwise, increase `left` to `mid + 1` (we need larger bags).
   - The final `left` value is the minimum penalty.

**Time Complexity**:
- `O(n log m)`, where `n` is the number of bags and `m` is the maximum number of balls in a bag.

**Space Complexity**:
- `O(1)`, since we use only a few extra variables.
