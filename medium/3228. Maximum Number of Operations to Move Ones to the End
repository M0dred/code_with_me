Approach:
- Traverse the string from left to right.
- Keep track of the number of '1's encountered so far (`count_one`).
- When a '0' is found, skip over all consecutive '0's (one group).
- For each such group of '0's, every '1' to its left can perform exactly one operation
  that moves it past the entire group (because the operation jumps over all consecutive '0's).
- Therefore, add `count_one` to the answer for each group of '0's.
- Groups of '0's at the end are never counted because no '1' can start an operation on them.

Time Complexity:  
O(n) – each character is visited at most twice (once when entering a '0' group, and once when skipping inside it).
Space Complexity:
O(1) – only a few integer variables are used.
