Approach:
- Use a 2D difference array (size (n+1) x (n+1)) to mark range updates in O(1) per query.
- For each query [r1, c1, r2, c2], increment diff[r1][c1], decrement at boundaries:
      diff[r1][c2+1] -= 1
      diff[r2+1][c1] -= 1
      diff[r2+1][c2+1] += 1
- Reconstruct the final matrix by computing 2D prefix sums on the difference array.
- This avoids TLE by reducing total time from O(q * n²) to O(n² + q).

Time Complexity:  O(n² + q) — O(q) for processing queries, O(n²) for prefix sum.
Space Complexity: O(n²) — for the difference array and result matrix.
