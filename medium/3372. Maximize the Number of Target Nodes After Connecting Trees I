Approach
1. Build adjacency lists for both trees from edges1 and edges2 to enable DFS traversal.
2. Compute the number of nodes within distance k from each node in tree 1 using DFS.
3. Compute the number of nodes within distance k-1 from each node in tree 2 using DFS.
4. For each node i in tree 1, calculate the total target nodes as count1[i] plus the maximum count2[j], and store in the answer array.
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the number of nodes in tree 1 and tree 2, as DFS visits each edge O(1) times.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) for adjacency lists and recursion stack.
