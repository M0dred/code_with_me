Approach:
1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - Convert the input list `nums` into a min-heap using `heapq.heapify(nums)`. This allows efficient extraction of the two smallest elements.

2. **Combine Elements:**
   - While the smallest element in the heap is less than `k` and the heap has at least two elements:
     - Extract the two smallest elements (`x` and `y`).
     - Combine them into a new element: `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)`.
     - Push the new element back into the heap.
     - Increment the operation counter.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, if the smallest element is still less than `k`, perform one final operation to ensure all elements meet the condition.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return the total number of operations performed.

Time Complexity:
- O(n log n), where `n` is the length of `nums`, as we repeatedly push and pop from the heap.

Space Complexity:
- O(n), for storing the heap.
