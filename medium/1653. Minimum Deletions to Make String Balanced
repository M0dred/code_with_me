Approach & Reasoning:

A balanced string has no 'b' before an 'a', which means the string must look like:
    "aaaa...bbbb..."
(all 'a' characters come before all 'b' characters).

Scan left to right and maintain:
- b_count: number of 'b' seen so far.
- deletions: minimum deletions needed to make the processed prefix balanced.

When we see:
1) 'b': it never breaks balance, so just increment b_count.
2) 'a': this 'a' is problematic if there were previous 'b's.
   We have two choices:
   - delete this 'a'  -> deletions + 1
   - delete all previous 'b's -> b_count
   Take the minimum:
       deletions = min(deletions + 1, b_count)

At the end, deletions is the minimum deletions to balance the whole string.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
