'''
Approach:
- Process contiguous blocks of identical colors.
- For each block, you must remove all but one balloon; to minimize time, keep the one with the largest neededTime and remove the rest.
- Sum (sum_of_block − max_in_block) over all blocks.

Time Complexity:
- O(n), single pass over the string.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) extra.
