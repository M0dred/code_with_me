"""
Approach & Reasoning:
We use post-order DFS to return two values from each subtree:
1. The maximum depth (height) of the subtree
2. The root of the smallest subtree that contains all deepest nodes in this subtree

Key logic:
- If left and right subtree have the same max depth → current node is the smallest one covering all deepest nodes
- If left subtree is deeper → answer lies in left subtree
- If right subtree is deeper → answer lies in right subtree

This is a classic post-order pattern to find the LCA-like node of all deepest leaves.
