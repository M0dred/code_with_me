Approach & Reasoning:

To form a square hole of side s (s x s cells):

- Need s consecutive rows of cells with no horizontal bars between them → s+1 consecutive horizontal bars with the inner s-1 bars removed.
- The inner s-1 bars must be removable → need s-1 consecutive removable horizontal bars.

- So max s = max_consecutive_removable_h + 1
- Same for vertical.

- Then max square side = min(max_s_h, max_s_v)
- Area = side ** 2

To find max_consecutive_removable:
- Sort the bar indices
- Find the longest chain where each next = prev + 1

Time Complexity: O(h log h + v log v) — sorting
Space Complexity: O(1)
