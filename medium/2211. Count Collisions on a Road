"""
Approach & Reasoning:
Every car that eventually stops contributes exactly 1 to the total collision count:
- When 'R' and 'L' collide → both stop → +2 collisions → each contributes 1
- When a moving car hits 'S' → moving car stops → +1 collision → contributes 1

Cars that never stop:
- All leading 'L's (nothing to their left)
- All trailing 'R's (nothing to their right)

All other cars will hit something and stop.

So total collisions = number of non-'S' cars in the middle segment (after removing escaping cars).

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
