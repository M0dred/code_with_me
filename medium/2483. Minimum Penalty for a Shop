"""
Approach & Reasoning:

We need to find the earliest closing hour j (0 <= j <= n) that minimizes the penalty.

Penalty for closing at hour j:
- Open hours: [0, j) → penalty = number of 'N' in this range
- Closed hours: [j, n) → penalty = number of 'Y' in this range

We use prefix sum of 'Y's to compute:
- Number of 'N' in [0, j) = j - prefix_Y[j]
- Number of 'Y' in [j, n) = total_Y - prefix_Y[j]

Iterate through all possible j, compute penalty, and track the minimum and earliest j.
