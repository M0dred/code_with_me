Approach & Reasoning:

We need to find the largest square that can fit inside the intersection of at least two rectangles.

Since the square must be completely inside some pairwise intersection region:
- We enumerate all pairs of rectangles (i < j)
- For each pair, compute their intersection rectangle (if exists)
  - lx = max(left bottoms), rx = min(right tops), etc.
- If intersection is non-empty (lx < rx and ly < ry), the largest square that can fit inside it has side length = min(width, height) = min(rx-lx, ry-ly)
- Track the maximum such side length over all pairs
- Final answer = max_side²

Time Complexity: O(n²) where n ≤ 1000 → acceptable (10⁶ operations)
Space Complexity: O(1)
