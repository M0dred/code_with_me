"""
Approach & Reasoning:

A smooth descent period is a contiguous subarray where each day (except the first) is exactly 1 less than the previous day.

Key observation:
- Every single day is always a valid smooth descent period (length 1).
- When we have a continuous decreasing sequence by 1, the number of valid subarrays ending at current position equals the current length of the sequence.

We iterate through the array:
- If prices[i] == prices[i-1] - 1 → extend current descent → length += 1
- Else → start new descent of length 1
- At each position i, add the current `length` to the answer (contributes that many new periods ending at i)

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
