Approach & Reasoning:
We are looking for the smallest number n made of only 1's (repunit) that is divisible by k.
Example: for k=3 → 111 (length 3), for k=7 → 111111 (length 6)

Key observations:
- Any repunit ends with digit 1 → if k is divisible by 2 or 5, n cannot be divisible by k (except k=1)
- We simulate building the number digit by digit using modulo:
      remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k
- If remainder becomes 0 → the current repunit is divisible by k
- There are only k possible remainders (0 to k-1)
  → By pigeonhole principle: if no 0 appears in first k steps, it will cycle → no solution

Thus, we only need to check up to k lengths.

Time Complexity : O(k)
Space Complexity: O(1)

This is the optimal solution used in interviews and accepted on LeetCode.
